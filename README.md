# Udacity Project P5 - Best Places in NYC

This is a single-page application, featuring a map of the 50 best places in NYC. This page allows you to quickly browse through the list of best places, see where it is located, and check tips from Foursquare.

This is a simple proof-of-concept application,  built as part of Project 5 for [Udacity Nanodegrees](https://www.udacity.com/nanodegree) course.


## Site Structure

The site was built using ~~Backbone.js~~ Knockout.js, Underscore.js and Twitter's Bootstrap. The structure followed the classic MVVM pattern, with good isolation between the view and the model.

The model was implemented using Knockout's observableArray. The filtering is simply a computedObject, that dynamically extracts a subset of the original dataset, according to search terms.

The maps are provided by [Google Maps API v3](https://developers.google.com/maps/documentation/javascript), and tips are provided by [Foursquare API](https://developer.foursquare.com/). API keys are needed to run the application.


## Main Functionality

* List of the 50 best places in NY, according to the site complex.com
* Google Maps conveniently shows the location
* You can narrow down the list by searching for a specific place or address
* You can also optionally search on the extended descriptions

## UX and Technical details:

* Search happens instantly, by filtering the model and re-rendering the view with the filtered locations, using KO's computedObject
* The number of locations found is displayed on top of the locations, using an observable variable
* The marker is customized with Foursquare's icon (e.g., Park, Bar, Restaurant, Hotel, etc)
* If the location is found on Foursquare, the Google Maps InfoWindow shows the first tip. You can click on next/previous arrows to see more tips (limited to 30)
* When the map InfoWindow is open and you click elsewhere on the map, the infowindow is closed automatically
* If the location is not found on Foursquare, the default Google Maps red marker is used (e.g., try "Sara Roosevelt Park")
* When the map InfoWindow is open and you click elsewhere on the map, the infowindow is closed automatically
* When you click on the search input field, there's a subtle shadown effect to show the field is not selected


## Responsive Design:

* Fully responsive. On smaller screens (phone, tablet), the site resizes automatically and eliminates some non-essential parts, like description
* The map size adjusts automatically to use the the full height of the device, using some CSS magic
* The description is truncated to 12 lines (some places have really long descriptions). The method used truncates the description at the end of a word, and shows an ellipsis. It works, but somewhat buggy and can be improved.


## Graceful Degradation:
* If the data file can't be loaded, it displays an error message, asking to try again later
* If Foursquare's API is not available, it simply shows the default marker and no infowindow with tips
* If Google Maps is not available, it won't show the map, but the user can still browse and search for venues


## Source Data

The data came from [complex.com 50 Coolest Places in NYC](http://www.complex.com/pop-culture/2014/07/the-50-coolest-places-in-nyc-right-now/). I created a parser in node.js, to convert from html to a json file. The parser runs automatically through Gulp (see below).


## Build System

I used [Gulp](http://gulpjs.com/) as the build system. Files are minified, images are compressed, debug logs are removed, and final files are moved from the `/src` to the `/dist` directory.

[Bower](http://bower.io/) was used to install components required by the application, like Bootstrap, Knockout.js and Underscore.js.

For debugging purposes, you can set the COMPRESS variable to false on Gulpfile.js, and it'll disable minification and will keep console.log statements intact. It will also improve performance a bit.
