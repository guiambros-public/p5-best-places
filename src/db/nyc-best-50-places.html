And while 3x1&apos;s Mercer Street storefront might not look like the most important place to buy jeans in the universe, it won&apos;t take more than a few seconds inside for you to figure the whole thing out. On the right are different cuts of denim, hung in plexiglass boxes on the wall, the fine art treatment for a pair of pants. Towards the back you&apos;ll probably catch a seamstress or two in the workshop, which is right there, in-house, working on jeans you could soon walk out wearing. In the center of the room, you&apos;ll find denim customizations of every possible variant, waiting for you to pick from them: Rivets, buttons, pocket shapes, linings, pipings, selvedge strips, interior pocket patterns. If there&apos;s a way to customize a pair of jeans, they have it, and they will do it. But nothing will prepare you for what&apos;s on the left side of the room: The Denim Wall. No, really: It&apos;s a wall that feels like a mountain, stacked topped to bottom with various giant spools of denim, and denim that&apos;s been personally collected from all over the world and brought here, for you. Black denim, grey denim, blue denim that fades to purple, purple denim that fades blue, denim as heavy as shag carpet or as light as tracing paper, denim that tastes like schnozzberries, etc. And yeah, we might&apos;ve made one of those up, but then again, having seen with our own eyes the variants of denim Morrison has collected, and what one can do with them: For the right price?

Still, there are some constants that most everyone can agree on: a bagel should be hand rolled, boiled, dense (but not too dense), chewy (but not too chewy), and well seasoned. Black Seed, SoHo's new haute bagelry, plays like the perfect amalgam of those variables. Bagels are small\u2014(no \"scooping\" here) but beautiful pieces of art. Toppings are also ingeniously devised, with the house-made beet-cured lox standing out as a highlight. Like most of the flavors at Black Seed, there's nothing overpowering about the fish, there's just an additional depth of flavor.) Also delicious is the tobiko caviar, which I would eat dangerous amounts of if given free reign in the kitchen. Something to note, however, is that the bagels really are small. If you want to get your fill, you'll have to order one of the excellent side-salads.

And both Tompkins in the East Village and Prospect in Park Slope certainly have their charms (respectively, wannabe crust punks ten years too late and every Brooklyn parenting cliche the borough has to offer). But square foot for square foot, Washington Square Park is maybe the most special of these places. On the west side of the park, the pickup chess game tables (where Stanley Kubrick was known to play). On the south side, a newly constructed plaza, usable park bathrooms, and a new grass knoll, built into and over the ground. On the east side, those guys with the piano, the Otto gelato cart, the arcade with the benches. In the center, every stripe of street entertainment, be they cliche (break dancers) or refined (jazz trios), but so often the most impressive the city has to choose from. And then, of course, the fountain, and the arches, as seen in movies ranging from <em>Kids<\/em> to <em>I Am Legend<\/em> (of course, most of the movies screened during warmer seasons in Washington Square Park <a href=\"http:\/\/frenchculture.org\/film-tv-and-new-media\/festivals\/films-green-2014\" target=\"_blank\">are in French<\/a>, such is this park's particular character).<\/p>\r\n<p>It's definitely not our city's most famed park, nor is it the greenest, but therein lies its most special charm: A pronounced lack of tourists, in one of the most touristy and ritzy neighborhoods in the city. It may be, as far as big parks go, the one most hidden in plain sight. And despite NYU buildings crowding up around it like an invasive species, the place still always feels diverse, alive, and quintessentially New York, in that it's a perfectly free, useful way to regularly remind ourselves of why we put up with all the shit we do to live here. \u2014&nbsp;<a href=\"https:\/\/twitter.com\/weareyourfek\" target=\"_blank\">Foster Kamer<\/a><\/p>","headline":"Washington Square Park","canonicalUrl":null,"titleTag":"Washington Square Park","metaDescription":null,"articleId":153302,"datePublished":1405754450000,"tags":[],"authors":[],"leadCarousel":[{"cloudinaryId":"nnwgp4f2xjv6cqsbfil9","format":"jpg","transformations":null,"width":620,"height":400,"type":"Image","caption":"Image via Wikipedia\n","altText":null,"id":1258870,"dateDeleted":null,"dateCreated":1405754450000,"dateUpdated":1416769991000,"class":"Image"}],"publishedBy":{"email":"digital@complex.com","name":"Digital Team","location":null,"alias":null,"attribution":null,"imageUrl":null,"metaDescription":null,"canonicalUrl":null,"titleTag":null,"bio":null,"id":1,"dateDeleted":null,"dateCreated":1405742962000,"dateUpdated":null,"class":"User"},"preview":{"cloudinaryId":"nnwgp4f2xjv6cqsbfil9","format":"jpg","transformations":null,"width":620,"height":400,"type":"Image","caption":null,"altText":null,"id":1258927,"dateDeleted":null,"dateCreated":1405754450000,"dateUpdated":null,"class":"Image"},"mobilePreview":null,"id":331927,"dateDeleted":null,"dateCreated":1405754450000,"dateUpdated":null,"class":"Slide","createdBy":{"email":"digital@complex.com","name":"Digital Team","location":null,"alias":null,"attribution":null,"imageUrl":null,"metaDescription":null,"canonicalUrl":null,"titleTag":null,"bio":null,"id":1,"dateDeleted":null,"dateCreated":1405742962000,"dateUpdated":null,"class":"User"},"updatedBy":null,"deletedBy":null},{"ordinal":15,"alias":"la-marina","content":"<p><strong>Neighborhood<\/strong>: Washington Heights<br \/><strong>Address<\/strong>: <a href=\"https:\/\/www.google.com\/maps\/preview?gl=us&amp;hq=la+marina+nyc&amp;daddr=348+Dyckman+St,+New+York,+NY+10034&amp;panel=1&amp;f=d&amp;fb=1&amp;geocode=FX6dbwIdiOKX-ykZ9APl_vPCiTG8onui4QBddA&amp;cid=8384859050327384764\">348 Dyckman St<\/a>.<br \/><strong>Website<\/strong>: <a href=\"http:\/\/lamarinanyc.com\/\" target=\"_blank\">lamarinanyc.com<\/a><\/p>\r\n<p>La Marina provides its guests with one of the best views in the city.

As book shopping becomes an evermore sterile experience, The Strand stands as a reminder that it doesn\u2019t have to be that way.\u2014&nbsp;<a href=\"https:\/\/twitter.com\/russbengtson\" target=\"_blank\">Russ Bengtson&nbsp;<\/a><\/p>","headline":"The Strand","canonicalUrl":null,"titleTag":"The Strand","metaDescription":null,"articleId":153302,"datePublished":1405754451000,"tags":[],"authors":[],"leadCarousel":[{"cloudinaryId":"xkanetsqpf2szhz7ytxd","format":"jpg","transformations":null,"width":936,"height":604,"type":"Image","caption":null,"altText":null,"id":1258920,"dateDeleted":null,"dateCreated":1405754450000,"dateUpdated":null,"class":"Image"}],"publishedBy":{"email":"digital@complex.com","name":"Digital Team","location":null,"alias":null,"attribution":null,"imageUrl":null,"metaDescription":null,"canonicalUrl":null,"titleTag":null,"bio":null,"id":1,"dateDeleted":null,"dateCreated":1405742962000,"dateUpdated":null,"class":"User"},"preview":{"cloudinaryId":"xkanetsqpf2szhz7ytxd","format":"jpg","transformations":null,"width":936,"height":604,"type":"Image","caption":null,"altText":null,"id":1258974,"dateDeleted":null,"dateCreated":1405754451000,"dateUpdated":null,"class":"Image"},"mobilePreview":null,"id":331961,"dateDeleted":null,"dateCreated":1405754451000,"dateUpdated":null,"class":"Slide","createdBy":{"email":"digital@complex.com","name":"Digital Team","location":null,"alias":null,"attribution":null,"imageUrl":null,"metaDescription":null,"canonicalUrl":null,"titleTag":null,"bio":null,"id":1,"dateDeleted":null,"dateCreated":1405742962000,"dateUpdated":null,"class":"User"},"updatedBy":null,"deletedBy":null},{"ordinal":19,"alias":"royal-palms-shuffleboard-club","content":"<p><strong>Neighborhood<\/strong>: Gowanus<br \/><strong>Address<\/strong>: <a href=\"https:\/\/www.google.com\/maps\/preview?ie=UTF-8&amp;fb=1&amp;gl=us&amp;cid=11662497669442294101&amp;q=The+Royal+Palms+Shuffleboard+Club&amp;ei=rMWpU9K7DZS1sATCz4HYCA&amp;sqi=2&amp;ved=0CJwBEPwSMAo\">514 Union St<\/a>.<br \/><strong>Website<\/strong>: <a href=\"http:\/\/royalpalmsshuffle.com\/\" target=\"_blank\">royalpalmsshuffle.com<\/a><\/p>\r\n<p>The Royal Palms Shuffleboard Club is an extremely low key place that invites its guests to step out of their normal happy hour routine and try something new for a change.

And all three regularly turn out some of the best coffee in Brooklyn, which for the longest time, was made with Stumptown beans.

After working with pioneering designers, musicians, and artists, Supreme has become a cultural landmark that anyone should check out if they are in the NYC area.&#x2014;<a href=\"https:\/\/twitter.com\/cedrich__\" target=\"_blank\">Cedric Hall<\/a><\/p>\n","headline":"Supreme","canonicalUrl":null,"titleTag":"Supreme","metaDescription":null,"articleId":153302,"datePublished":1405754451000,"tags":[],"authors":[],"leadCarousel":[{"cloudinaryId":"dzmefqifpgafbrz2casy","format":"jpg","transformations":null,"width":620,"height":400,"type":"Image","caption":"Image via EUNUM\n","altText":null,"id":1258923,"dateDeleted":null,"dateCreated":1405754450000,"dateUpdated":1416770328000,"class":"Image"}],"publishedBy":{"email":"digital@complex.com","name":"Digital Team","location":null,"alias":null,"attribution":null,"imageUrl":null,"metaDescription":null,"canonicalUrl":null,"titleTag":null,"bio":null,"id":1,"dateDeleted":null,"dateCreated":1405742962000,"dateUpdated":null,"class":"User"},"preview":{"cloudinaryId":"dzmefqifpgafbrz2casy","format":"jpg","transformations":null,"width":620,"height":400,"type":"Image","caption":null,"altText":null,"id":1258984,"dateDeleted":null,"dateCreated":1405754451000,"dateUpdated":null,"class":"Image"},"mobilePreview":null,"id":331965,"dateDeleted":null,"dateCreated":1405754451000,"dateUpdated":1426806969000,"class":"Slide","createdBy":{"email":"digital@complex.com","name":"Digital Team","location":null,"alias":null,"attribution":null,"imageUrl":null,"metaDescription":null,"canonicalUrl":null,"titleTag":null,"bio":null,"id":1,"dateDeleted":null,"dateCreated":1405742962000,"dateUpdated":null,"class":"User"},"updatedBy":{"email":"brandon.nydell@complex.com","name":"Brandon Nydell","location":null,"alias":"brandon-nydell","attribution":"Brandon Nydell","imageUrl":null,"metaDescription":null,"canonicalUrl":null,"titleTag":null,"bio":null,"id":890,"dateDeleted":null,"dateCreated":1405746259000,"dateUpdated":1405775150000,"class":"User"},"deletedBy":null},{"ordinal":27,"alias":"kiehls","content":"<p><strong>Neighborhood<\/strong>: Various<br><strong>Address<\/strong>: <span><a href=\"https:\/\/www.google.com\/maps\/place\/Kiehl&apos;s\/@40.749615,-73.9845219,14z\/data=!4m5!1m2!2m1!1skiehl&apos;s!3m1!1s0x0:0x9bbed0612f72f671\" target=\"_blank\">109 3rd Ave.<\/a><\/span><br><strong>Website<\/strong>: <a href=\"http:\/\/kiehls.com\/\" target=\"_blank\">kiehls.com<\/a>&#xA0;<\/p>\r\n<p>It may seem strange to put a luxury cosmetics shop on a list filled with bars, music venues, and restaurants, but Kiehl&apos;s, whether you know it or not, is as much of a New York institution as Russ &amp; Daughters or the New York Public Library.

It\u2019s an institution. In 2015, it will have been around for 80 years. The number of musicians who have graced its stage is staggering. You walk down 15 steps and find yourself in a small room with cramped tables and a host, Lorraine Gordon, who does not give a shit who you are or what you\u2019re doing in the club that her husband opened in 1935. She\u2019s there to uphold some unspoken rule about making sure jazz musicians know that they still have a place to call home in New York City. Recording a live album at the Village Vanguard is a badge of honor that any self respecting Miles Davis-lover would appreciate. The only thing better than listening to a live version of Sonny Rollins recorded at the Vanguard, is to see him there on the stage. You don\u2019t even have to be a jazz fan to love this place. You just need to appreciate its deep history in the New York arts scene. Once you\u2019re there, you\u2019ll realize that the history and legend is seeping through the walls.

Whether you're a lifelong comic book lover, or just curious about getting back into them, you owe it to yourself to visit Bergen Street Comics. \u2014 <a href=\"https:\/\/twitter.com\/nathanreese\" target=\"_blank\">Nathan Reese<\/a><br \/><br \/><\/p>","headline":"Bergen Street Comics","canonicalUrl":null,"titleTag":"Bergen Street Comics","metaDescription":null,"articleId":153302,"datePublished":1405754450000,"tags":[],"authors":[],"leadCarousel":[{"cloudinaryId":"wfrdir95d1thcv7xegb5","format":"jpg","transformations":null,"width":620,"height":400,"type":"Image","caption":"Image via StudioPhototrope\n","altText":null,"id":1258907,"dateDeleted":null,"dateCreated":1405754450000,"dateUpdated":1416770571000,"class":"Image"}],"publishedBy":{"email":"digital@complex.com","name":"Digital Team","location":null,"alias":null,"attribution":null,"imageUrl":null,"metaDescription":null,"canonicalUrl":null,"titleTag":null,"bio":null,"id":1,"dateDeleted":null,"dateCreated":1405742962000,"dateUpdated":null,"class":"User"},"preview":{"cloudinaryId":"wfrdir95d1thcv7xegb5","format":"jpg","transformations":null,"width":620,"height":400,"type":"Image","caption":null,"altText":null,"id":1258979,"dateDeleted":null,"dateCreated":1405754451000,"dateUpdated":null,"class":"Image"},"mobilePreview":null,"id":331957,"dateDeleted":null,"dateCreated":1405754451000,"dateUpdated":null,"class":"Slide","createdBy":{"email":"digital@complex.com","name":"Digital Team","location":null,"alias":null,"attribution":null,"imageUrl":null,"metaDescription":null,"canonicalUrl":null,"titleTag":null,"bio":null,"id":1,"dateDeleted":null,"dateCreated":1405742962000,"dateUpdated":null,"class":"User"},"updatedBy":null,"deletedBy":null},{"ordinal":35,"alias":"robertas","content":"<p><strong>Neighborhood<\/strong>: Williamsburg<br><strong>Address<\/strong>: <a href=\"https:\/\/www.google.com\/maps\/place\/Roberta&apos;s\/@40.705145,-73.933598,17z\/data=!3m1!4b1!4m2!3m1!1s0x0:0xa1a529cc35093e02\">261 Moore St<\/a>.<br><strong>Website<\/strong>: <a href=\"http:\/\/robertaspizza.com\/\" target=\"_blank\">robertaspizza.com<\/a>&#xA0;<\/p>\r\n<p><span>It might as well be the town hall of Bushwick, since it&apos;s also the North Brooklyn neighborhood&apos;s biggest draw.

That isn&apos;t to say that the Neapolitan pies coming out of those massive ovens aren&apos;t worth showing up for, because they are, and maybe have a higher hype-to-reality quotient than any other piece of pizza in New York.

It\u2019s a place where \u201890s hip-hop from both coasts flows as readily as their white peach sangria, and where daily specials supplement the fairly basic menu. As for that menu, it\u2019s primarily their housemade, locally sourced meatballs (natch) and what to have them over or on, including the traditional pasta as well as white beans or polenta. The Kitchen Sink, three balls over a medley of roasted vegetables and green salad fortified with apple slices, is spot-on for summer.

C.O. Bigelow Chemists is to your average CVS (or worse: Duane Reade) what a four-star restaurant is to McDonald's, without the four-star price difference, but with the kind of charms and products that can make your own drug store appear basic in every way possible. You can see it from afar\u2014it's the only place on Sixth Avenue marked by a sign advertising DRUGS in giant, red, glowing neon letters. And yes, they do indeed have drugs, as an actual drugstore would: Prescription bottles and small white baggies adorned with their classic cursive script logo.<\/p>\r\n<p>But it's so much more than a drugstore. If there's any kind of product that might go in your bathroom, they have it.

Their own famous in-house brand is represented, as well, of course: Skin tonics, scents, candles, nearly all of the above. But if you choose to go your own way, chances are, someone in the store could speak to whatever product you're looking at all too well. From the glass counters to carpet and mosaic tile mix, from the signage to the cranky if not well informed pharmacists, C.O. Bigelow really does have something for everyone, and is one of the most perfect present shopping destinations in the city.

Tell that to anyone who's tried walking out to the far reaches of industrial Bushwick, Brooklyn to get to Bun-Ker. But if they make it past the railroad tracks, and North Brooklyn's greatest\/worst\/only strip club Pumps, they will finally find what they have been looking for: A tiny shack of a building that serves Vietnamese food. And yet, it's a shack that holds wonders (and not even the kind that thinks \"Bandz a Make Her Dance\" is part of the Great American Songbook). Run by an odd combination of former four-star chefs and skate rats, Bun-Ker is everything you've heard about New York City's revolutionary Asian cuisine, but without the bullshit or frills. It all carries a core of authenticity that's filtered through smart adjustments to flavor that elevate it beyond the realm of religiously authentic and into a greater, higher purpose: Damn great food as a reasonable price. The bahn-mi is as close to a perfect sandwich as you'll find, as is the pho for a bowl of noodles, which goes without mentioning the tomato fried rice, the crab spring rolls, and so on. It's all great, and in a fun, communal, kinda BYOB environs. But the Bahn-Xeo is what you've come in search for\u2014a stuffed and fried egg crepe as crispy as it is light, served with a handful of veggies and herbs to hold its contents: egg, shrimp, bacon, to name a few. It's the most unconventional egg sandwich you'll ever eat, and also, the greatest. Just make sure to get the appropriately decadent ending to that meal you deserve: A cab ride.

But as far as skateparks went it always lagged behind, whether because of legal issues, property values or just the fact that the city itself was its own park. There were ramps, most notably at Mullally Park in the Bronx, Chelsea Piers, and later Millennium Park in Brooklyn, but nothing downtown save for the quasi-official Brooklyn Banks under the bridge. That\u2019s all changed. Coleman Skatepark under the Manhattan Bridge started as just a collection of prefab ramps and obstacles, but has since grown to be a legit park, complete with steel-coping transition and any number of ledges and manual pads. It\u2019s home to several annual contests and jams both official and unofficial\u2014including Harold Hunter Day\u2014as well as daily sessions for kids of all ages.

There&apos;s Spam, of course, thrown into an above-par musubi and an exceptional fried rice. And the Kalua Pig, pulled pork cooked for hours, bursting with juicy flavor in every bite, if you even have to chew it (you barely do). And of course, accouterment typical of island plate lunches, the aforementioned rice, macaroni salad (nuanced, as macaroni salad goes) and a few greens. The menu&apos;s topped off by one of the most genius drink programs in the city: Pick of one two rums, pick one of these juices (but really, go for the lilikoi), and here&apos;s a jar with ice. Have fun.

It&apos;s hard to imagine a Hawaiian not getting homesick here. But that&apos;s ultimately why Onomea&apos;s so great. Sure, it might fill a desperately needed gap in New York&apos;s food culture, while also elevating blue collar Hawaiian cuisine, and do it well enough to withstand the not-so-shaka mainland types here. But critically, and in more than name, it also feels like that thing so many chefs and restauranteurs strive for: A genuine expression of home.<em>- <\/em>Foster Kamer<\/p>\n","headline":"Onomea","canonicalUrl":null,"titleTag":"Onomea","metaDescription":null,"articleId":153302,"datePublished":1405754450000,"tags":[],"authors":[],"leadCarousel":[{"cloudinaryId":"zczfubyrcgxdc1zx1mc6","format":"jpg","transformations":null,"width":620,"height":400,"type":"Image","caption":"Image via NewYorkDailyNews\n","altText":null,"id":1258905,"dateDeleted":null,"dateCreated":1405754450000,"dateUpdated":1416771028000,"class":"Image"}],"publishedBy":{"email":"digital@complex.com","name":"Digital Team","location":null,"alias":null,"attribution":null,"imageUrl":null,"metaDescription":null,"canonicalUrl":null,"titleTag":null,"bio":null,"id":1,"dateDeleted":null,"dateCreated":1405742962000,"dateUpdated":null,"class":"User"},"preview":{"cloudinaryId":"zczfubyrcgxdc1zx1mc6","format":"jpg","transformations":null,"width":620,"height":400,"type":"Image","caption":null,"altText":null,"id":1258948,"dateDeleted":null,"dateCreated":1405754450000,"dateUpdated":null,"class":"Image"},"mobilePreview":null,"id":331936,"dateDeleted":null,"dateCreated":1405754450000,"dateUpdated":1426807000000,"class":"Slide","createdBy":{"email":"digital@complex.com","name":"Digital Team","location":null,"alias":null,"attribution":null,"imageUrl":null,"metaDescription":null,"canonicalUrl":null,"titleTag":null,"bio":null,"id":1,"dateDeleted":null,"dateCreated":1405742962000,"dateUpdated":null,"class":"User"},"updatedBy":{"email":"brandon.nydell@complex.com","name":"Brandon Nydell","location":null,"alias":"brandon-nydell","attribution":"Brandon Nydell","imageUrl":null,"metaDescription":null,"canonicalUrl":null,"titleTag":null,"bio":null,"id":890,"dateDeleted":null,"dateCreated":1405746259000,"dateUpdated":1405775150000,"class":"User"},"deletedBy":null},{"ordinal":50,"alias":"prospect-park-lake","content":"<p><strong>Neighborhood<\/strong>: Prospect Heights<br \/><strong>Address<\/strong>: <a href=\"https:\/\/www.google.com\/maps\/place\/Prospect+Park\/@40.660204,-73.968956,17z\/data=!3m1!4b1!4m2!3m1!1s0x0:0x178bf7c600df7a98\/\" target=\"_blank\">Prospect Park<\/a><br \/><strong>Website<\/strong>: <a href=\"http:\/\/prospectpark.org\/\" target=\"_blank\">prospectpark.org<\/a>&nbsp;<\/p>\r\n<p dir=\"ltr\"><span>If there\u2019s a place where the best of the \u201cold New York\u201d\u2014read: rough around the edges\u2014meets the best of the \u201cnew New York\u201d better than at Prospect Park Lake, I don\u2019t know it. Nestled into the far southern bootheel of the park (no shame if you\u2019ve never been), the lake was long a place that was very rough around the edges. Literally so, with a shoreline that was murky at best and a shifting tide of sludgy urban mud at worst.
