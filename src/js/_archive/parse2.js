    There are days you want to eat something, and others where you want to eat <em>everything<\/em>. On the latter, you&#39;d be well-advised to head to Gotham West Market. The multi-vendor gastro wonderland is an indecisive eater&#39;s dream. Unlike similar concepts like Chelsea Market, Gotham West has only eight carefully-chosen vendors, each of which occupies a small slice of the sleek space. Sit at Cannibal&#39;s counter and take down a pig&#39;s head cuban sandwich at Cannibal, or\u00a0<a target=\"_blank\" href=\"http:\/\/www.complex.com\/city-guide\/2014\/03\/the-best-ramen-in-nyc\/ivan-ramen-slurp-shop\">slurp a bowl of Ivan&#39;s savory rye noodles.\u00a0<\/a>\u00a0Stop by\u00a0Genuine Roadside for a burger and a side of &#39;70s nostalgia, or wash down tapas with Rioja at chef Seamus Mullen&#39;s tapas bar. Sure, it&#39;s avenues away from a subway, but with a Blue Bottle and a bike store on premise, Gotham West&#39;s many diversions can easily consume an entire afternoon. Or, have you consuming for an entire afternoon. Both are strong options. \u2014 <a target=\"_blank\" href=\"https:\/\/twitter.com\/ShanteCosme\">Shant&eacute; Cosme<\/a><br \/>\r\n\u00a0

<p>Outside of Japan, New York is just about the best city for ramen in the world. You have Ippudo, Momofuku, Ivan, Chuko, Totto, and that's just off the top of my head. Still, Bassanova Ramen stands out when it comes to wild flavors and radical experimentation. Founded by&nbsp;Japanese-American Chef Keizo Shimamoto who learned his craft at the original Bassanova&nbsp;in Japan, the recipes include ingredients like Thai curry and truffle oil added to the rich <em>dashi<\/em>. The Tondaku Green Curry Ramen, in particular, is one of the best bowls&nbsp;I've had in recent memory.
